üìÑ Documentation: Adaptive Learning Prototype
1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement:

Traditional learning assessment tools do not adapt to individual student needs.
Students often face:
1.Repetition of topics they already know.
2.Difficulty identifying weak areas.
3.Lack of personalized practice questions.

Goal: Build an adaptive AI-powered tool to:
1.Assess students dynamically (easy ‚Üí medium ‚Üí hard).
2.Identify learning gaps in listening, grasping, retention, and application.
3.Provide personalized practice questions.
4.Allow teachers and parents to monitor progress.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Approach / Problem Solving:

1.Adaptive Assessment Logic:
-Questions change difficulty based on student responses.
-Correct answers ‚Üí next question harder; wrong answers ‚Üí easier or same level.

2.Gap Analysis:
-Track performance in multiple dimensions (Listening, Grasping, Retention, Application).
-Identify weak topics automatically.

3.Personalized Practice:
-Recommend practice questions targeting the student‚Äôs weak areas.

4.Dashboards:
-Student: Shows progress, gaps, and recommended practice.
-Teacher: Tracks multiple students and overall performance.
-Parent: Monitors child‚Äôs improvement and weak areas.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Solution Design:

Dashboards:
- Student Dashboard
- Teacher Dashboard
- Parent Dashboard

Components:
Component	Responsibility
React Frontend	UI, dashboards, question rendering
Adaptive Logic Module	Question difficulty adjustment, gap tracking
Node.js Backend	API endpoints, data handling
Chart.js / SVG	Visual representation of progress & gaps
Database (optional)	Store student responses and history
4Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation

1.Frontend:
-Built using React.js
-Components: Dashboard, QuestionCard, ProgressChart, PracticeSection
-State management with useState and useEffect

2.Backend:
-Node.js + Express (if required)
-APIs for submitting answers, fetching questions, and generating reports

3.Adaptive Algorithm:
function getNextQuestion(currentDifficulty, isCorrect) {
    if (isCorrect) {
        return currentDifficulty + 1; // move to harder question
    } else {
        return Math.max(1, currentDifficulty - 1); // easier question
    }
}

4.Gap Analysis
-Score each dimension: Listening, Grasping, Retention, Application
-Example:

const gapScore = {
  listening: correctAnswersListening / totalListeningQuestions,
  grasping: correctAnswersGrasping / totalGraspingQuestions,
  retention: correctAnswersRetention / totalRetentionQuestions,
  application: correctAnswersApplication / totalApplicationQuestions
};


5.Dashboard Visualization
-Use Chart.js for radar/bar charts to visualize gaps and progress.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion
-Adaptive Learning Prototype provides personalized assessment and actionable insights for students, teachers, and parents.
-Encourages efficient learning by focusing on weak areas.
-Can be extended with AI-powered recommendations, gamification, and mobile app support.
